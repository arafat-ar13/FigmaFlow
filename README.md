# FigmaFlow - Gen Code **just** from images!

Being a backend web engineer, it is difficult to come up with good front-end design code. That's where Figma comes in - a powerful collaborative design tool that lets designers create user interfaces, prototypes, and mockups in a visual environment. Figma has become the industry standard for UI/UX design as it allows teams to design, prototype, and gather feedback all in one place, significantly cutting down on the back-and-forth between designers and developers. However, taking those beautiful Figma designs and turning them into actual code was traditionally a time-consuming process that required careful recreation of every component. Not anymore! FigmaFlow is a VS Code extension that can turn your Figma designs directly into code, dramatically speeding up development by eliminating the need to manually translate designs into HTML/CSS from scratch. This automation helps bridge the gap between design and development, letting engineers focus on implementing business logic rather than pixel-perfect UI recreation.

FigmaFlow is able to convert a given screenshot or image of a Figma design and use AI Vision technologies to process that image into actual, usable HTML and CSS code that is over 95% similar to the original image. Not only Figma, the extension is able to replicate any webpage design image that you can feed it.
